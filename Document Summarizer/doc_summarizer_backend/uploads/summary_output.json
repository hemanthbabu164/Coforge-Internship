    "Optimal  Machine Learning Techniques  to Predict Air Quality\nIndex  125003105 \u2013 HEMANTH BABU CHAVA 125003174 \u2013 MANJUNATH P 125003232 \u2013 PRAVANTH DEVAKI  Abstract:\nThe rapid growth in various  sectors has resulted in increasing concern over air\npollution in the modern world. Monitoring pollutant levels is crucial for regulating\nconcentrations and taking prompt actions when pollution rises, allowing authorities to\nmaintain control over environme ntal quality. To maintain ambient air quality, regular\nmonitoring and forecasting of air pollution is necessary and this can be achieved by\npredicting the Air Quality Index  (AQI) . The AQI  is a numerical scale that communicates the\nquality of air in a speci fic location based on the concentrations of various air pollutants .\nManual monitoring stations to gather pertinent data entails significant expenses for both\ninstallation and maintenance.  Since regular monitoring and prediction of the AQI are critical\nfor combating air pollution. To accomplish  this objective, machine learning  (ML)  has\nemerged as a promising approach for predicting the AQI when compared to trad itional\nmethods. In this work, to predict the AQI different ML  algorithms  are used such as ensemble\nmethods based Bagging and Boosting.  The open -source data from the Central Pollution\nControl Board (CPCB), covering a certain period of time in a region  is going to be analysed.\nThe contam inants like Particulate Matter, gaseous pollutants and key meteorological\nparameters that contribute to the AQI  are considered for analysis. The available dataset is\npre-processed and subjected to Exploratory Data Analysis with required transformations,\nbefore splitting it into Training and Testing sets. The primary focus of this work  is to figure\nout the  most effective ML framework that is scalable and reusable for any city of choice with\nthe data from CPCB. To arriv e at this, the various performance metri cs (like correlation\ncoefficient, MAE, MSE,  RMSE) of the different models used in predicting the AQI values\nand other factors like generalization ability, robustness to outliers, flexible model\ncustomization and reusability  are going to be analysed .": {
